# Ad Sets

Campaigns can have multiple ad sets, if supported by the partner.

Whenever you create a new network, ad sets are automatically enabled or disabled. Prominent examples for partners with ad set support are Facebook, TikTok, AdColony and Tapjoy.

#### Creation

For campaigns with ad set support, an additional tab `Adset` will appear in the campaign details view. Ad sets can either be manually created, or will automatically be created once justtrack receives a click / view with a new, unknown ad set or once we receive spend for a new, unknown ad set.

#### Data Granularity

All relevant data such as spend, revenue, impressions and installs as well as KPIs are also available on ad set level. In order to view these statistics, please add one or multiple ad set dimensions to the table.

#### Country Handling

If you add a new country to the ad set that is not present on the campaign yet, it will be added to the campaign.
