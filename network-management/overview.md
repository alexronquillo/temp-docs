# Overview

A **network**, or ad network, is a service that pairs marketing teams who have a certain need with a publisher who has a certain inventory. You use them to build campaigns and reach the right audience for your application.

In justtrack, you can connect your account to a large set of popular ad networks, or you can even connect a custom network.
