# Manage ad network attributes

In this guide, you'll learn to view and edit attributes, such as keys, tokens, and IDs for your connected ad networks.

## Before you begin

Any **Member, Manager,** or **Admin** in your organization can view network attributes. Only **Admins** and **Managers**, however, can edit them. So, to complete the steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct role.

Network connections, and therefore network attributes, are configured per app. So, the first thing to do is navigate to network attributes in the app page.

## Navigate to ad network attributes

In the _Main Menu_, click [**Admin -> Apps**](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/apps):

Then, select an app. This opens the _App Hub_ where you can see or edit details about your app.

On the _Advertisement_ card, click **Manage Integration**:

From here, you can view and edit your network attributes in the following sections:

* **Attribution Configurations:** Configure attributes related to network attribution for your connected networks.
* **Network Attributes:** Configure general attributes related to your connected networks.
* **Postback Configurations:** Configure attributes related to postbacks for your connected networks.

To update these attributes:

1. Click **Edit** and make your changes.
2. Click **Save** to save your changes.
