# Manage network attributes

In this guide, you'll learn to view and edit attributes, such as keys, tokens, and IDs for your connected networks.

## Before you begin

Any **Member, Manager,** or **Admin** in your organization can view network attributes. Only **Admins**, however, can edit them. So, to complete the steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct role.

Network connections, and therefore network attributes, are configured per app. So, the first thing to do is navigate to network attributes in the app page.

## Navigate to network attributes

In the _Main Menu_, click [**Admin -> Apps**](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/apps):

* [Network Revenue Import](manage-network-attributes.md#edit-network-revenue-import-attributes)
* [Network Attribution](manage-network-attributes.md#edit-network-attribution-attributes)
