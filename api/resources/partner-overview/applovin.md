# Applovin

Applovin is a video ad network. When you set up Applovin as an ad network for justtrack, the following configuration will already be automatically set up:

* Tracking links and the URL placeholders
* Postbacks
* SKAd network id
* Automated campaign creation based on clicks and views

Justtrack also supports the following UA automation and optimization features, which need to be set up individually:

* Cost Integration
* Bid Management
* Creative Management

### Cost Integration, Postbacks

Please enter the `Report Key` into the justtrack Applovin network page. You can retrieve the key directly from the Applovin dashboard by navigating to `Account` --> `Keys` --> `Report Key`. Once the key is entered, we automatically import cost data.

For postbacks, please enter the `SDK Key`.
