description: Set up Ironsource as an ad network
---

# Ironsource

Ironsource is a video ad network. When you set up Ironsource as an ad network for justtrack, the following configuration will already be automatically set up:

* Tracking links and the URL placeholders
* Postbacks
* SKAd network id
* Automated campaign creation based on clicks and views

Justtrack also supports the following UA automation and optimization features, which need to be set up individually:

* Cost Integration
* Bid Management
* Creative Management

### Credentials

Additionally, credentials need to be set up to use the services. We recommend to create a separate justtrack account for your Ironsource account, so it is not tied to a person.

Justtrack requires the following parameters to be filled in Ironsource's network page:

* `Username`
* `Password`
* `Secret Key`
* `Refresh Token`

Please navigate to your account details in the Ironsource dashboard, and select the `API` tab. Please copy the `Secret Key` and `Refresh Token` from here.
