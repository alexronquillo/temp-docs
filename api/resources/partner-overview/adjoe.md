# Adjoe

When you set up Adjoe as a partner for justtrack, the following configuration will already be automatically set up:

* Tracking links and the URL placeholders
* Postbacks
* SKAd network id
* Automated campaign creation based on clicks and views

Justtrack also supports the following UA automation and optimization features, which need to be set up individually:

* Cost Integration
* Bid Management
* Campaign Management

### Campaign Structure

Adjoe supports campaigns that can have multiple targeting groups. Justtrack is set up to support this structure for Adjoe as well.

A campaign on justtrack side equals a campaign on Adjoe side. Targeting groups are represented by adsets in justtrack.

Campaigns and adsets are automatically created once we receive the first click or view.

{% hint style="info" %}
Targeting groups can only have the same set of countries that the campaign has.
{% endhint %}

### Bid Management

Justtrack supports bid adjustments on:

* country level
* sourceId level
