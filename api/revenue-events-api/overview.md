# Overview

For many revenue providers justtrack offers a S2S solution to receive revenue postbacks in real-time and directly from the revenue provider. Moreover, after receiving and processing the revenue events, justtrack can forward the events to an API of your choice.

Alternatively, our customers can send revenue events to justtrack directly.
