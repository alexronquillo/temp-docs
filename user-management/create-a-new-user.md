# Create a new user

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a new user for your organization. Among other things, this lets you:

* Assign them a role
* Control their access permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no limit to the amount of users your organization can have.
{% endhint %}

## Before you begin

Only **Admins** can view, create, and edit users. So, to complete the steps in this guide, you must first be an Admin for your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about the Admin role in [User roles and permissions](user-roles-and-permissions.md).
{% endhint %}

## Create a new user

In the _Main Menu_, click **Admin ->** [**User Management**](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/managers):

Then, click **Add User**:

This opens the _Create User_ modal where you'll input your user's information and select their role. There are two important things to consider here:

* When you create a new user, a random password is automatically generated. Only Admins can change a user's password.
* You'll assign your user to one of four roles: Admin, Manager, Member, and External. Learn more about these roles in [User roles and permissions](user-roles-and-permissions.md).

When you've added all the user's information and selected a role, click **Create**:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/create-user-modal (1).png" alt="Arrow pointing to the Create button" width="563"><figcaption><p>Create User</p></figcaption></figure>

This creates the user with the information you entered in the previous step.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Now, you need to provide the generated password to your team member so they can access the account.
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion

That's it! You created a new user for your organization. You can now see the user's profile on the _User Management_ page.

If you need to, you can manage the user there. For example, you can:

* [Activate or deactivate the User](activate-or-deactivate-a-user.md)
* [Change their Role](change-a-users-settings.md)
