# Troubleshoot common issues

If you run into an issue when managing users, one of these suggestions may help you troubleshoot the issue.

### Use an Admin user

Only [Admins](user-roles-and-permissions.md#admin) can view, create, and edit users. If you're not an Admin and you need to perform one of those tasks, ask another Admin to [change your role](change-a-users-settings.md).

### Select the correct organization

If you have multiple organizations, make sure to select the correct one for your new user on the _User Management_ page:
