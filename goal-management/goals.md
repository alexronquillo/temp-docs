# Overview

With **goals**, you can track and report certain behaviors that users take in your application. They group information about an event with extra details about how users trigger that event.

Goals are app-specific. So, from [**Admin -> Apps**](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/admin/apps), you can:

* [Create a goal](create-a-goal.md)
* [Manage existing goals](manage-existing-goals.md)
