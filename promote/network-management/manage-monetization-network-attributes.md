# Manage monetization network attributes

In this guide, you'll learn to view and edit attributes, such as keys, tokens, and IDs for your connected monetization networks.

## Before you begin

Any **Member, Manager,** or **Admin** in your organization can view network attributes. Only **Admins** and **Managers**, however, can edit them. So, to complete the steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct role.

Network connections, and therefore network attributes, are configured per app. So, the first thing to do is navigate to network attributes in the app page.

## Navigate to ad network attributes

Then, select an app. This opens the _App Hub_ where you can see or edit details about your app.

On the _Monetization_ card, click **Manage Integration**:

From here, you can view and edit your network attributes in the following sections:

* **Revenue Import:** Configure attributes related to importing revenue data from your connected monetization networks.
* **Purchase Verification Credentials:** Upload and manage your purchase verification credentials for the relevant app store.

To update these attributes:

1. Click **Edit** and make your changes.
2. Click **Save** to save your changes.
