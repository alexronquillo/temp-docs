# Overview

One important way to optimize your campaigns is to adjust how much you pay for ad space and, therefore, users. With justtrack, you can change the amount of money you want to bid for ad space across many of our integrated partners.

You can adjust bids in two ways:

1. **Automatically** by uploading a CSV file containing multiple bid adjustments.
2. **Manually** by adjusting individual bids in the justtrack dashboard.

In this section you'll learn about bidding in justtrack and different ways to manage bids.
