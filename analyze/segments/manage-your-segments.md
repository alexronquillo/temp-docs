# Manage your segments

In this guide, you'll learn how to manage user segments in justtrack.

## Navigate to your dashboard

You can create and edit segments from any data analytics page in justtrack, such as:

* [Statistics](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/advertising/statistics)
* [Cohort Analysis](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/app-analytics/cohort-analysis)
* [Monetization](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/app-analytics/monetization)

For this guide, you'll use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.justtrack.io/dashboard):

From here, you can add and edit your segments. You can also use your segments to compare segmented data.

## Add a segment

From the dashboard, click **Add Segment**:

This opens the [_Segment Builder_](overview/segment-builder.md). Filter the values for each dimension to define your segment:

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to **Confirm** each filter you edit and **Apply** all the changes when you're finished. Otherwise, we won't apply your changes or build your segment.
{% endhint %}

With your changes applied, you'll be able to compare data from your segments in many analytics pages within the platform:

This opens the [_Segment Builder_](overview/segment-builder.md). Filter the values for each dimension to define your segment, like you would to [add a segment](manage-your-segments.md#add-a-segment). Then, click **Apply**.

## Delete a segment

Click the **X** next to a segment to delete it:
