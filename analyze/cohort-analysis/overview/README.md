A [**cohort**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/4favyoz2l7ENoW5stOlK/glossary-and-definitions/cohort) is a group of users that installed an app on the same day. You can use the _Cohort Analysis_ page to aggregate, analyze, and visualize trends based on cohorts. For example, you can analyze your app's retention over time and take action to improve that metric based on your findings.

Here are the key features of the _Cohort Analysis_ page:

* You can [configure your metrics](configuring-your-metrics.md) and how they're displayed in the [_Cohort Analysis_ table](cohort-analysis-table.md).
* You can [compare cohorts](comparing-segmented-cohorts.md) across multiple user segments.
* You can [visualize selected data](cohort-analysis-table.md#visualizing-days) in a line graph.
* You can download your configured cohort data in CSV format.

To get started, check out our guide on [analyzing user retention](../analyze-user-retention.md).
