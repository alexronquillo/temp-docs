# Comparing segmented cohorts

By default, _Cohorts Analysis_ groups users based on the default user segment: **all users**. This means that the data in the table shows all users from all countries and networks (or lack-thereof) who install any of your apps.

However, you can focus on more specific user segments in a cohort, or even compare cohorts across multiple user segments.

{% hint style="info" %}
Read our guide to learn how to [manage your segments](../../segments/manage-your-segments.md).
{% endhint %}

## Using the table&#x20;

When you've defined multiple user segments, the _Cohorts Analysis_ table shows cohort-aggregated data for each of the segments in sequence:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can even click the cohort icon in the table to reconfigure a user segment.
{% endhint %}

## Using the chart

When you select days to visualize in the chart, you'll also find that each of the segments is present:
