## Creative Management

Transmitting creatives to facebook is done in multiple use cases:

1. Transmitting creative sets to existing or new ad sets
2. Testing creatives using justtrack's creative test feature (IPM, CTR)

### Supported Creative-Sets

* Video (1) + Headline (1-5) + Primary Text (1-5)
* Video (1) + Playable (1) + Headline (1-5) + Primary Text (1-5)

Go to [the Facebook developer site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) and create an app for your business account.

### Needed data

![Data structure](<../.gitbook/assets/fbpublish.drawio (1).png>)

1. You need an app which you want to promote. Create a `product` and a client for `ios` and/or `android`.
2. The client, you want to promote, needs the `network attributes` Facebook `App URL` and Facebook`Page ID`. Add them in the dashboard.
3. If you publish a creative-set to Facebook, justtrack will create an ad with the name of the creative-set. Justtrack needs to know for which adSet it should create an ad. Add the [Facebook ad set id](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2534657046763437) to the `externalId` of the ad Set in our dashboard.
4. Add the [Facebook Business id ](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1181250022022158?id=180505742745347)to the Campaign Attribute `act`
