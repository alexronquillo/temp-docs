# Network

A **Network**, or ad network, is a service that pairs marketing teams who have a certain need with a publisher who has a certain inventory. Networks are inventory resellers in that they purchase ad inventory from many publishers and resell that inventory to advertisers whose demand matches the supply. Example Networks include [AppLovin](https://www.applovin.com/) and [Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/).
