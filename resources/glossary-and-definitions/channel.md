# Channel

A **channel**, or marketing channel, is the platform through which you reach your target audience. For example, you may use an ad on YouTube, a post on social media, or a banner in a game. These are all channels, which your network can use to market your app.

Channels are used at the campaign-level. If you don't specify a channel for a campaign, we'll default to the channel you assign to the network.

**Incentivised Channels:** Some channels are incentivised, which means users have an incentive to interact with the ad. For example, they might get in-game currency if you install the app.
{% endhint %}

In justtrack, you can use channels to organise your campaigns, filter data, and more.
